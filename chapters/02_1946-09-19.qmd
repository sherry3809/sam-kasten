By nature, {{< var tate >}} was one of those types of people who would always be inspired by something. Needless to say, he was a {{< var chasid >}} - a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makarov_(Hasidic_dynasty)">{{< var Makarover >}} {{< var chasid >}}</a>. When he was able to tear himself away from his livelihood in the village, he left for {{< var Makariv >}} to see the {{< var rebbe >}}^[Rabbi, but specifically one who leads a {{< var chasidic >}} dynasty], and when he came back from there he was completely different and he would tell one story of the {{< var chiddush >}}^[[halakhic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halakha) innovation; new way of doing something in orthodox Judaism] that he saw at the {{< var rebbe >}}'s, and he sang all the {{< var nigunim >}}^[songs/tunes, "lai-dai-dai" etc.] that he heard there. 


In general, at our house, in the small village of {{< var zat >}}, there was such atmosphere that you could literally see and feel how {{< var tate >}}'s faith in God and in his {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}} were connected with everything - When the business went well and we didn't have any problems with the landowner, {{< var tate >}} was sure that it was thanks to the blessings and wishes that the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}} gave him, and so, he should go the first chance he has to the Rebbe and give him the fine fruit and be joyous together with the other {{< var chasidim >}}.

And on the other hand if, God forbid, business went poorly and people had to endure the landowner's caprices, they really needed to go to the rabbi, pour out their bitter heart to him and beg for him to give his blessing and pray that God will help. Also, when something happened in the house and someone in the household was not healthy, the father of the family went to the {{< var rebbe >}} and asked him to grant him a {{< var refua-shlema >}}^[healing]. Believing in God and in them, holy _rebbes_, was connected. Even with the {{< var nigunim >}} that we used to sing at home, during a {{< var simcha >}}^[joyous occasion with religious connotation], or even there heartache...

In his enthusiasm for the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}, it wasn't enough for {{< var tate >}} that he drove to him from time to time; He also brought the {{< var rebbe >}} to our home a few times a year, and usually there was a great joy and the local Jewish farmers from all the surrounding shtetls came to us in {{< var zat >}} Weekly and during the three meals^[referring to three meals of Shabbat], people swallowed with admiration every word that the {{< var rebbe >}} uttered from his mouth during the {{< var dvar-toireh >}}^[sermon] about the {{< var parsheh >}}^[Torah portion] of the week.

As far as my father could go in his enthusiasm for the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}} {{< var tzadik >}} ^[righteous man], you can imagine what happened when the {{< var rebbe >}} came to us in {{< var zat >}} - when {{< var tate >}} heard that the {{< var rebbe >}} had been spotted in his rickshaw at the gate of the village, he went out to meet him with a song, and singing like this, he unharnessed the horse from the rickshaw and accepting the reins with both hands, he himself led the great {{< var rebbe >}} in the rickshaw our home. You could see on his face that this gave him so much pleasure and he considers it such a great {{< var mitzvah >}} that he would not give it up for all the treasures in the world.


To this day, I still have that picture in front of my eyes and I see {{< var tate >}} so clearly, as he is carrying the {{< var rebbe >}}'s rickshaw and his face is shining with joy. I also remember what kind of joy there was in general at our house every time when {{< var tate >}} brought down the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}; The Jewish farmers of the neighboring villages, all simple healthy and strong Jews, but ardently chasidic and very pious, are suddenly very different people; It turned out that it was none other than the {{< var ruakh-hakodesh >}} ^[holy power] who also started floating them. Just as if a miracle had happened, all of a sudden the rustic arrogance is gone from them and they entered into such a spiritual nobility that was never seen before.

And they sang with such fervor that it was a pleasure to listen to them, and they danced with such exuberance as if they were carrying themselves in the air... Among them, among the chasidim, for the first time in my life I saw how Jews dance. And I liked it so much that I went and danced with them... I was still a little boy then, and during the dance I fell flat on my feet. When my father saw that I was doing all the {{< var chasidic >}} practices and I was singing along to the song, he was overjoyed with it and he gave me a pinch on the cheek: 'Well done, {{< var shmuelikel >}} - he said - "well done."

The other {{< var chasidim >}} were also very excited because I, a little boy, who is as big as an elf, entered and took over the manner of their dancing so quickly. And one of them, a prophet of the Makarover {{< var rebbe >}}, a man with a long beard, a reddish complexion, and with two long hands, very plump, said to my father afterwards: "Look, look, {{< var Leybs >}}! He is indeed something very similar to you, the little one! ... Well, may God help you, that you should devote yourself to the {{< var torah >}} and to the {{< var chuppah >}} and to good deeds... He is growing, isn't he... He is a growing vessel..."


Dancing is my love, so I planted myself between Jewish and {{< var goyishe >}} dances. It didn't matter to me, just dance. It was enough for me to hear some song, I started immediately dancing to it. I even went around the village dancing. And to this day, I don't understand what was so great about me then, what made me so high in the air, that soon I was dancing... but there came a time when I stopped dancing and could not be as happy as usual. This was when {{< var tate >}} suddenly started worrying about his health.


"I'm sick, {{< var Feige >}}" - he often said to {{< var mame >}} - "I'm very sick... and somehow my heart tells me that it's not good. Not good..."

He then went to the {{< var rebbe >}} several times and the {{< var rebbe >}} wished him a {{< var refua-shlema >}}, but it didn't help. He complained to himself: 

-- I am sick, {{< var Feige >}}, very sick. 

No matter how small I was, I still felt and understood that because he complains so often about his poor health, a very difficult time is falling on us, and this caused me a bitter blackness. And when I once got carried away, as is usually the case with a child, and I began to sing some kind of song, sometimes a Yiddish one and sometimes a {{< var goyishe >}} one, and while singing, I began to dance along, {{< var mame >}} scolded me:

--You should be ashamed, Shmuel'ikel. ashamed; Father is sick and so are you...

The whole house became a different place when {{< var tate >}} became ill. And nothing was done about the illness, because in the village there was no doctor, no field doctor and not even a pharmacy. No matter how much they begged {{< var tate >}} to bring him a doctor from {{< var vasil >}}, or from {{< var bt >}}, he did not want to. This was not possible for him in any way, and he had an answer to everything:: "What can a doctor help me with? How long I am destined to live in the world? Well, I'm alive...The doctor will not give me more years to live; A man is in God's hands...'


With great difficulty, they worked with him to bring the doctor from {{< var vasilch >}}, a kind of popular Jew, who had only one cure for all the diseases in the world. And he, the doctor from {{< var vasilch >}}, gave the father some prescription and told him that if things didn't get better to call him again... At that time, my oldest sister, {{< var Batsheva >}}, was already engaged, and it is worth telling the story of how this match was made, because all around it is very characteristic of the Jewish life of that time:

Among the {{< var chasidim >}} that my {{< var tate >}} often met at the Makarover Rebbe's court, there was one {{< var radetsky-full >}}. {{< var radetsky >}}, a Jewish landowner, lived in the town of {{< var rybinka >}}^[now known as ["Hrebinka"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrebinka)], which is not far from {{< var vasilch >}} and just like my father, he was also an ardent chasid, a zealot, and he often went to the {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var rebbe >}}'s. As it usually happens, at the rejoicings at the {{< var rebbe >}}'s court, people often drank {{< var lchaim >}}^[Cheers; "to life"] and wished for salvation for the Jews. And once, when my father was drinking {{< var lchaim >}} with {{< var radetsky-full >}} from the town of {{< var rybinka >}}, for a while they were already talking about this and that, whatever just came to the tongue; Each time, someone else poured a cup of brandy and, as usual, an "order" started:

- {{< var Lchaim >}}! May God will it so!
- {{< var lchaim >}} {{< var toivm-u-sholem >}} ! God bless you, and so it will be!

So, little by little, they drank another glass and another glass, and showered each other with blessings and wishes, and in the conversation that took place between them, my father told {{< var pinya >}} that his wife is pregnant and he hopes that, {{< var baruch-hashem >}}^["[Blessed be G-d](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5694247/jewish/What-Does-Baruch-Hashem-Mean.htm)"], the birth will pass peacefully. And when {{< var pinya >}} heard this, he got excited and told {{< var tate >}} that his wife was also preparing to give birth. Soon, in the blink of an eye, it was already agreed between the two {{< var Makarover >}} {{< var chasidim >}} that if the wife of one gave birth to an boy and the wife of the other gave birth to a girl, there should be a match.

And they shook hands, made a {{< var tekkaf >}}^[formal Jewish agreement]. And so it remained. A short time after that, my mother gave birth to a girl and she was named {{< var Batsheva >}}. {{< var radetsky-full >}}'s wife also gave birth to a boy and he was named Aron. And so, as agreed in the {{< var tekkaf >}}, because the wife of one {{< var chasid >}} gave birth to a girl and the other gave birth to a boy, it was said that it is {{< var beshert >}} and this is a marriage {{< var m-hashamayim >}} ^[from heaven (hebrew/religious term)].

And so, my sister {{< var Batsheva >}}, the oldest of all the children in our family, was already a bride immediately after she was born. And that's how she was really treated even when she was still a very little girl: "{{< var Batsheva >}}, the bride." {{< var Tate >}} loved {{< var Batsheva >}} very much and he showed her a lot of tenderness, not only when she was still a little girl, but when also when she was grown, and he was looking forward to the time when they will lead her to the {{< var chuppah >}}.

And just in that year, when it was decided to have {{< var Batsheva >}}'s wedding on the {{< var shabes >}}^[Shabbat] after {{< var shavues >}}^[Shavuot], {{< var tate >}}'s health was already so poor that it was no wonder that he couldn't think about anything other than whether he would live to be with his first daughter at the wedding, or not... You could tell from how he suddenly started working to move the marriage from {{< var shabes >}} after {{< var shavues >}} to instead be two weeks before {{< var pesach >}}^[Passover]... "I want to be at the wedding of my eldest daughter," - he said - "I want to take her to the {{< var chuppah >}}..."

At that time, apparently, his knew in his heart that that he would not live for long. He felt it. Everyone in the family felt it. And therefore we decided not to wait for my sister {{< var {{< var Makarover >}}sheva >}}'s wedding until until {{< var shabes >}} after {{< var shavues >}}, but rather two weeks before {{< var pesach >}}, as my father wishes...
And they began to prepare for the great {{< var simcha >}}, when, with God's voice, they will lead to the couple, who were blessed with a {{< var tekkaf >}} before they were born, to the {{< var chuppah >}}. And while preparing for the wedding, people also prepared for a funeral...

You had to think about it, even when you didn't want to, because {{< var tate >}} was already so sick and he was feeling so bad that you knew that he would not live much longer. He himself knew this more than anyone else. And that's why {{< var tate >}} often repeated the only thing that made sense to him at the time: "I want to be with my eldest daughter at the wedding... I want to lead {{< var Batsheva >}} to the {{< var chuppah >}} and I beg God, may he give me strength so that I may see before my death that my family honors the {{< var tekkaf >}}..."

And he counted the days that remained until two weeks before {{< var pesach >}}. And he looked forward to the good hour...I also counted the days left until the wedding. But I did not understand the silent tragedy that was taking place there. I was still too young to understand this. I just wanted dance at the first wedding in our family...
