# October 3rd, 1946

Selling matches on the streets of Philadelphia become something of a game for me, not just a way to make a living. That's how I approached it. And little by little I became so interested in the various people who bought the matches from me that I didn't just call out my goods for sale, but I sang them out in my own way: "Parlor matches, three for five! Parlor ma-a-a-tches, three for fi-yi-yi-ve!" And in my mind, something of that _nigun'dl_^[_nigun_ is song, "dl" suffix is a little endearment], which I heard from the badchen Berele Shakhnes, lingered... 

I didn't make any great fortunes, but still I considered myself a "big earner." And when I bought a suit with my own money and dressed like a real _Americaner boi_[^ written `אמעריקאנער באי`], I was literally in seventh heaven and felt like no one was my equal.

That's how I passed the time, and I picked up a lot of English in the street, and I even was able to argue even with a policeman. And then a Galician Jew suggested to me that I join him in nearby villages and we could earn a bit of money there. He was a peddler, the Galician Jew, who made the proposal to me; He sold towels and tablecloths and laundry and handkerchiefs and other such things, which he kept in a heavy suitcase; With this suitcase he _schlepped_ around the nearby villages around Philadelphia, and there he already had customers everywhere, even regular "customers" who bought from him on loan; He toiled hard and saved as much as he could, because he wanted to bring his wife and children to America as soon as possible.

Every time he came into our house, he talked about it and complained that he was just a wandering foreigner without a home; He really wanted to have a home and moreover, he really missed his wife and children whom he left behind in a some shtetl in Galicia; He also complained that he had trouble _schlepping_ the heavy suitcase around the surrounding villages, because he was afraid of dogs...

And apparently, that is actually he wanted me to go with him to the villages; I will sell my matches, the "parlor-matches" sold at the price of "three for five," and he will sell his towels and tablecloths and all the other things that he carried in the heavy suitcase.
It would be more _haimlicher_^["homey", implying a comfort/ease - think "haimish"].

He was sure that with such a smart and lively young man like me, he would no longer need to be afraid of the dogs, and moreover, he wouldn't feel so miserable and he would have someone to speak to in Yiddish. He talked for so long to my _mame_, the Galician Jew, until she agreed to give her consent for me to join him in the villages. And that's how I became a villager in America...

I later picked up the English language in the villages. I even learned a couple of English songs and sang them. And the Galician Jew with the heavy suitcase was very pleased that I had joined him; He wasn't so lonely and cheerless anymore with me coming along, because I was always happy; In everything I did, above everything else, I found the "comedy"^[he keeps a sense of humor about everything], and when my heart was in a good place - whether I sold a lot of matches, or for some reason or another - I would sing out at the top of my voice.

The _lidlach_^[songs: _lidel_ is a song, so _lidlach_ is a little song, like a little ditty] I knew - in Yiddish, Ukrainian, and also English - I would sing along my way to the nearby villages, and anyone who could spare a shilling would buy matches from me.
In one village, a young woman - a Christian - caught my eye; I liked her so much that when I came to her to sell matches, she welcomed me as a very distinguished guest and it almost become love between us. She twisted my head so much that I walked around bewildered, as though in a haze. But this is something it's best not to talk about...

After a while^[his [Lekskion](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/K/kasten-sam.htm) (encyclopedia) entry suggests he sold matches for about a year], I was tired of _shlepping_ around the villages, and I was really sick of selling matches. I could no longer say the same thing and the same thing over and over again: "Parler matches, three for five...." I was simply disgusted by it. And then a _landsman_^[implies someone from the same region in the old country as him] took me into his shop and taught me the craft of sewing shirts...
I became a "shirt-maker,"^[שירט–מעיקער] as it is called in America, and among the other _landsman_ who worked there, they said that this is better than pearls, because in America trade/craft is - a _broche_^["bracha" - blessing]...

Working in the shop was completely different in those days than it is now; They worked longer hours and labored much harder than now. But one of the things that made working in the shop stand out at that time was that people sang while working...

And I really enjoyed that.

What _didn't_ Jewish workers sing while working in the shop! They knew all the songs from _Shulamis_^[An operetta by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Goldfaden">Abraham Goldfaden</a>, the father of Yiddish theater. - <a href="https://web.uwm.edu/yiddish-stage/plotting-yiddish-drama/shulamis-oder-bas-yerusholayim">Play synopsis.</a>], from _Bar Kochba_^[Abraham Goldfaden - <a href="http://web.uwm.edu/yiddish-stage/plotting-yiddish-drama/bar-kokhba-der-zun-fun-di-shtern-oder-di-letste-teg-fun-yerusholayim">Play synopsis.</a>] and from the other Jewish plays inside out. In addition, they knew many other Jewish songs. Beautiful folk songs, which evoked the warmest feelings in everyone. And together with the noise of the machines, or better said, over the noise of the machines, which have been working full-speed since the early hours of the night, the air was full of songs of love other heartfelt Jewish folk _nigunim_...

Jews who came to America from different countries and marinas - from Ukraine, from Lithuania, from Poland, from Galicia, from Romania, and from anywhere else - all worked and sang in the shop. And everyone brought with him a different style, different nuances, and sometimes even a new song that we hadn't heard before. And everyone sang. We couldn't not sing while working. It was very difficult to imagine how work in the shop could have gone without it...

And it's safe to say that we often "sang _chazan_ tunes"^[A literal verb "chazan" here, meaning they chanted/sang religiously inspired tunes you might expect in a cantorial setting] as well. The workers would sing _chazan'ishe shtiqlakh_^[little bits of _chazan_ music] like this, going up like smoke^[unclear idiom here, but presumably a good thing - filling the air maybe?]. And it was normal that, that in the middle of the day, amidst the noise of the sewing machines, you could hear voices^[Below I've directly written the _Hebrew_ (not Yiddish) as Sam wrote it out. This is a liturgical tune.]

> יעלה, יעלה תחנו–ני–נו מערב
> ויבוא שועתי–נו–נו מבוקר
> ויראה רנוני–נו–נו עד ערב

And soon everyone has has joined in, and it would become a "sing-along" in rounds. I remember how once our _landsmen_ in Philadelphia suddenly started making a fuss^[has a positive connation here] about a new _chazan_ who came to _daven_ in the "Russian Shul"^[Jews attended a shul that founded by their _landsmen_. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Congregation_B%27nai_Abraham#Russian_Shul,_1874-1891">The "Russian Shul"</a> is <a href="https://www.phillyshul.com/history-timeline/">B'nei Abraham</a>, which today is a chabad shul on Lombard between 5th-6th.] We heard that he was brother of the famous _chazan_ [Pinie Minkowski](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/minkowski-pinchas), and he came from the city of Belaya-Tserkva, which Jews called _Sdeh-Levan_^[This is the city's Hebrew; it means "white fields"] and also _Schwartz-Tuma_^[This is the city's Yiddish name: "black sin/uncleanliness/<derogatory term for church>", which is a play on words since the Ukrainian name, "Bila Tserkva," means "white church"].

More than anyone else, the _tumult_^[ruckus; again, here it is a positive connation] was strongest from the the Belaya-Tserkovans. But also the Vasylkivers, the Rybinkers, the Solovinkers, and all the other _landsmen_ who were from that general area. And when everyone went to shul on Shabbat to hear the new _chazan_, I also went.
  And I liked his prayers very much, and before that I actually took over from him the tunes of a few prayers and afterwards I sang them in my own way, in the church and also in the shop at work...
