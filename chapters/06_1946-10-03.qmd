# October 3rd, 1946

Selling matches on the streets of Philadelphia become something of a game for me, not just a way to make a living. That's how I approached it. And little by little I became so interested in the various people who bought the matches from me that I didn't just call out my goods for sale, but I sang them out in my own way: "Parlor matches, three for five! Parlor ma-a-a-tches, three for fi-yi-yi-ve!" And in my mind, something of that _nigun'dl_^[_nigun_ is song, "dl" suffix is a little endearment], which I heard from the badchen Berele Shakhnes, lingered... 

I didn't make any great fortunes, but still I considered myself a "big earner." And when I bought a suit with my own money and dressed like a real _Americaner boi_[^ written `אמעריקאנער באי`], I was literally in seventh heaven and felt like no one was my equal.

That's how I passed the time, and I picked up a lot of English in the street, and I even was able to argue even with a policeman. And then a Galician Jew suggested to me that I join him in nearby villages and we could earn a bit of money there. He was a peddler, the Galician Jew, who made the proposal to me; He sold towels and tablecloths and laundry and handkerchiefs and other such things, which he kept in a heavy suitcase; With this suitcase he _schlepped_ around the nearby villages around Philadelphia, and there he already had customers everywhere, even regular "customers" who bought from him on loan; He toiled hard and saved as much as he could, because he wanted to bring his wife and children to America as soon as possible.

Every time he came into our house, he talked about it and complained that he was just a wandering foreigner without a home; He really wanted to have a home and moreover, he really missed his wife and children whom he left behind in a some shtetl in Galicia; He also complained that he had trouble _schlepping_ the heavy suitcase around the surrounding villages, because he was afraid of dogs...

And apparently, that is actually he wanted me to go with him to the villages; I will sell my matches, the "parlor-matches" sold at the price of "three for five," and he will sell his towels and tablecloths and all the other things that he carried in the heavy suitcase.
It would be more _haimlicher_^["homey", implying a comfort/ease - think "haimish"].

He was sure that with such a smart and lively young man like me, he would no longer need to be afraid of the dogs, and moreover, he wouldn't feel so miserable and he would have someone to speak to in Yiddish. He talked for so long to my _mame_, the Galician Jew, until she agreed to give her consent for me to join him in the villages. And that's how I became a villager in America...

I later picked up the English language in the villages. I even learned a couple of English songs and sang them. And the Galician Jew with the heavy suitcase was very pleased that I had joined him; He wasn't so lonely and cheerless anymore with me coming along, because I was always happy; In everything I did, above everything else, I found the "comedy"^[he keeps a sense of humor about everything], and when my heart was in a good place - whether I sold a lot of matches, or for some reason or another - I would sing out at the top of my voice.

The _lidlach_^[songs: _lidel_ is a song, so _lidlach_ is a little song, like a little ditty] I knew - in Yiddish, Ukrainian, and also English - I would sing along my way to the nearby villages, and anyone who could spare a shilling would buy matches from me.
In one village, a young woman - a Christian - caught my eye; I liked her so much that when I came to her to sell matches, she welcomed me as a very distinguished guest and it almost become love between us. She twisted my head so much that I walked around bewildered, as though in a haze. But this is something it's best not to talk about...
