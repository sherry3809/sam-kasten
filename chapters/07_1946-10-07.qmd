# October 7th, 1946

> Note to readers: Based on dates on which memoir articles were supposed to be published, it is _quite possible_ that we are missing an article that would have come out on Oct 5th. Unfortunately, that edition is not available in either the National Library of Israel archives or in the New York Public Library archives.
> That said, there is no gap in the story that Sam is telling, so it is possible there simply wasn't a _Forverts_ edition on 10/5/46 and/or there was no memoir article published in that edition.

Heine-Chaimovich

I played an extra in no more than two or three performances with Heine-Chaimovich and Max Karp's troupe. After that, they didn't need me anymore and told me I could go home. As it usually went, they didn't me pay for it. It didn't even occur to me to ask to be paid.

In general, Yiddish troupes at that time would recruit local men and women to be "the folk" in the play^[If you need a hoard of commoners, get some locals to be extras!]. In every city there were more than a few people who rushed to the stage for this, and were satisfied just to be so close to the great performers who they used to talk about with such enthusiasm. The stage drew them in like a magnet. And some of them actually became actors and actresses - and more than one of them made it to the top ranks and became famous...

In the shop where I worked as a shirt-maker, the spirit of Yiddish theater pervaded more than ever; there was no one who didn't take the opportunity to go see the troupe who came from New York to Philadelphia for only a few performances. And since everyone knew I was on the stage with them, I was greatly exalted. They would request from me, 

-- Nu, Sam, how does that _lidel_ go, which they sing in that one scene? Nu, how?

And I didn't make them beg, and I sang. And more than anything, the song [_Rozhinkes mit Mandlen_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raisins_and_Almonds)^["Raisins and Almonds", a well known Yiddish lullaby originally from _Shulamis_.] I had to sing it for them several times a day, and everyone used to sing with me. And it started like this^[full lyrics in English and Yiddish: https://www.hebrewsongs.com/?song=rozinkesmitmandlen]:

> In the synagogue, in a corner of a room, 
>
> Sits the widowed daughter of Zion, alone.
>
> She rocks her only son, Yidele, to sleep
>
> With a sweet lullaby.


And then everyone in the shop, amidst the noise of the machines, immediately joined in as though they were all "fully qualified":


> Ai-liu-liu-liu!

And so it went, just as if we were, here in the shop, putting on our own performance. And after the "_ai-liu-liu_"s were done, I continued:

> Under Yidele's cradle
>
> Stands a small white goat, 
> 
> Who went to market to sell his wares.
> 
> This will be Yidele's calling, too.
>
> Trading in raisins and almonds.
>
> Sleep, Yidele, sleep!

Like this, all day long, I sang. And after the sung, everyone "licked their fingers"^[idiom - they really enjoyed it, as in "finger-licking good"] over it.

-- Ya, that is good!

-- Ya, that is sweet as sugar!

The spirit of the Yiddish theater filled the whole shop even more a little later when **Mogulesko**, the great and famous [Sigmund Mogolesko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Mogulesko)^[Nickname "Zelig;" he was _the_ most beloved comedian of the early Yiddish theater, bar none. Read his leksikon entry <a href="https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/M/mogulesko-sigmund.htm">here</a>. He and Sam would later become close friends, and Sam loved and admired him dearly.], came to Philadelphia for a few performances. All of Philadelphia went crazy over this, and it was no wonder - like in many other cities in America, he already had many ardent and passionate fans before he even arrived. His fans were Ukrainian, Moldovan, and Romanian Jews who remembered his from back home. They had seen him perform in Odessa, in Bucharest, in Iasi, and many other cities in Europe. They couldn't forget him, because even back in the old country, his acting inspired them, and when people talked about him, they said in the whole world there is no one better than him. When he performed in a theater, the crowds' voice filled the air with great joy:

-- Brava, Mogulesko! Brava, Mogulesko! 

His talent spread like a rumor at those times, when Jews would come to see him play Yiddish theater in cities like Odessa and Iasi. It was in those times when the Yiddish theater was picking up speed^[it was the early days of Yiddish theater - it was catching on and becoming popular, bigger, etc.]

Mogulesko came to Philadelphia to play the piece "The Coquettes,"^[Literally translated as "The Coquettish Ladies." You can read the whole play <a href="https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:433925510$5i">here</a>. This comedy was written by the famous author/playwright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahum_Meir_Schaikewitz#:~:text=Nahum%20MeÃ¯r%20Schaikewitz%2C%20also%20known,and%20Hebrew%20novelist%20and%20playwright."><_Shomer_>. ] where he could show himself in all his glory.[^From cross-referencing in his Leksikon entry, we know this took place in 1887.] He played the role of the libertine who later becomes old and broken and no longer recognizable. And in the same performance, he also appeared in the role of _Bubbe Shprintzeh_^[He made a serious impact playing this role of a grandmother. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessie_Thomashefsky">Bessie Thomashefsky</a> (who we will meet later), incidentally, was also in attendance - she describes this show in Philadelphia in her memoirs; she also dedicated a whole chapter to how much she loved seeing Mogulesko in this role.]. And when he started singing the song "Yankele," everyone remained seated as if tied to their seats, and they swallowed every word and really _kvelled_ from the song.

And Mogulesko performed the role of _Bubbe Shprintzeh_ with such grace and such charm, that it was no wonder that he enchanted the whole audience.
Oh, how beautifully and how sweetly he sang!

> My husband used to _daven_ with twelve singers.
>
> Ah, my dear Yankele!
>
> Women used to lick their fingers^[idiom; means "really enjoyed"] from his singing.
>
> My dear Yankele!
> 
> After his prayers we would run out of energy.
>
> My dear Yankele!
> 
> Tell me, tell me, have you ever seen something like this?
>
> No, no, no, 
>
> But I was lucky to live to see it.

What a song Mogulesko sang - even when the words didn't rhyme, it was such a pleasure to listen to his sing it that it didn't matter. You really couldn't believe it, how he charmed the audience with his artistic grace. You'd have to travel the whole world over to find another artist as good as him. 

And I remember that when I saw him for the first time, in Philadelphia in the pay "The Coquettes," I remained seated as though I had suddenly been transported to an entirely different world. And when the curtain fell and they turned the lights back on in the theater, I jumped on stage and went behind the curtain.

I felt that I had to say something to him, the man who performed such wonders on the stage. I had to express my enthusiasm^[or, "how inspired I was"]! I had to touch his hand! I had to thank him for the "spiritual pleasure" that he had given me.

This feeling gripped me so tightly that there was nothing I could do to escape it. I suddenly just forgot that, fundamentally, I have a reserved/shy nature, not someone who elbows their way in somewhere. And when I went behind the curtain and said, that I **had** to see Mogulesko, they passed me from person to person. And it went on like this until a Jew^[It it worth noting that they generally referred to fellows Jews as "Jew" rather than, here for example, "man"] loomed up from underground - a healthy Jew, a tall Jew, who spoke in such a way that you could immediately recognize he was Romanian; he told me to follow him, and while leading me, he shouted out loud:

-- Hey, _Zeligel_^[Yiddish endearment nickname for "Zelig"], some guy asked to see you...

And I still remember how strange it was to me, that this man used a nickname - Mogulesko himself! - as though he would have them be equals, and called him "Zeligel"...

When I was introduced to Mogulesko in his dressing room and I suddenly realized how near I was to him, I was left standing in a daze and I suddenly forgot everything that I had planned to say to him[^Sam literally wrote: "suddenly everything I was going to say before went out of my head"]. 

Only when Mogulesko stretched out his hand to me and I saw a "good" face, a kind face, I mustered the courage and I started to say, 

-- It is an honor for me, a great honor, to shake your head... I thank you...


He was, it seems, used to things like this, so he smiled, and then I became even bolder:

-- And I tell you now, Mister Mogulesko, that I want to be actor just like you... I mean, I want to be actor.

Immediately after, I was shocked that I said that; it occurred to me that it was a _chutzpah_^[audacity, insolence] for me to have said something like, "Mogulesko is an actor, and I want to be an actor!" Who am I and what did I do?! And what does it mean that "I want"? Well, it means that that is what I want!

But Mogulesko wasn't offended by what I had said. "Good," he replied. "This pleases me. And if you indeed become an actor, we will certainly see each other again..."

Then he became very busy and I could not spend any more time with him. As I was leaving, I shook his hand, and I wanted to say so much more to him, but I didn't say anything...
