> How I became an actor. -- My first role in Goldfaden's [_The Sorceress_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorceress_(play))^[Known in Yiddish as "Di kishefmakherin" (the "spell-maker") or "Bubbe Yachne" (this is the witch's name). You can read a synopsis <a href="https://web.uwm.edu/yiddish-stage/plotting-yiddish-drama/di-kishefmakherin">here</a>. This play was recently revived by the <a href="https://nytf.org/the-sorceress/">Folksbiene</a> (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj6yNao9I6BAxUXlokEHbtYBX8QFnoECCIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2019%2F12%2F18%2Ftheater%2Freview-the-sorceress-yiddish.html&usg=AOvVaw1rrFq-N8ca6AyZIiFJeOWI&opi=89978449">NYT review</a>).]. -- The Yiddish theater audiences of 50 years ago.^[In this memoir article, the newspaper began including little introductions of what the article contains.]

Making the acquaintance of Mogulesko bewildered/dazed me so much, that I couldn't take working in the shop at all. Everything I saw of him on stage always floated before my eyes. I remembered every movement he made, every expression that appeared on his face. His unique "stage grace," which really has no equal, was so deeply engraved in my memory that I could never forget it. And because I was always thinking so much about Mogulesko and the show he played in Philadelphia, I started to yearn to act in the theater even more than before.
I simply wanted to begin my life as an actor. The stage cast a spell on me. But every time, when I started talking about this at home, _mame_ would cut off my wings:

-- Get this stupidity out of your head - she said. - Like we don't have enough actors in the family...^[I am not entirely confident in this translation, but I think it is roughly correct at least in terms of the sentiment. She may be referring to Bessie Thomashefshky, who has already run away with Boris - and is her niece.]

It was difficult for me to cause _mame_ such grief; I have always behaved so that she should not suffer any shame from me. In this case, however, I could not obey her, as I had firmly made up my mind that, should there even be thunder and lightning, I must be an actor!

A short time after Mogulesko left, the actor [Jacob Gartenstein](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/G/gartenstein-jacob.htm) arrived in Philadelphia with a troupe, and when I heard this, I was very interested and I already saw that he should be talked to about me and Piel I asked him to give me an opportunity to play a role.
He was a very unique person, Jacob Gartenstein, and it will not be superfluous to mention here some details of his biography:
