> How I became an actor. -- My first role in Goldfaden's [_The Sorceress_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sorceress_(play))^[Known in Yiddish as "Di kishefmakherin" (the "spell-maker") or "Bubbe Yachne" (this is the witch's name). You can read a synopsis <a href="https://web.uwm.edu/yiddish-stage/plotting-yiddish-drama/di-kishefmakherin">here</a>. This play was recently revived by the <a href="https://nytf.org/the-sorceress/">Folksbiene</a> (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj6yNao9I6BAxUXlokEHbtYBX8QFnoECCIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2019%2F12%2F18%2Ftheater%2Freview-the-sorceress-yiddish.html&usg=AOvVaw1rrFq-N8ca6AyZIiFJeOWI&opi=89978449">NYT review</a>).]. -- The Yiddish theater audiences of 50 years ago.^[In this memoir article, the newspaper began including little introductions of what the article contains.]

Making the acquaintance of Mogulesko bewildered/dazed me so much, that I couldn't take working in the shop at all. Everything I saw of him on stage always floated before my eyes. I remembered every movement he made, every expression that appeared on his face. His unique "stage grace," which really has no equal, was so deeply engraved in my memory that I could never forget it. And because I was always thinking so much about Mogulesko and the show he played in Philadelphia, I started to yearn to act in the theater even more than before.
I simply wanted to begin my life as an actor. The stage cast a spell on me. But every time, when I started talking about this at home, _mame_ would cut off my wings:

-- Get this stupidity out of your head - she said. - Like we don't have enough actors in the family...^[I am not entirely confident in this translation, but I think it is roughly correct at least in terms of the sentiment. She may be referring to Bessie Thomashefshky, who has already run away with Boris - and is her niece.]

It was difficult for me to cause _mame_ such grief; I have always behaved so that she should not suffer any shame from me. In this case, however, I could not obey her, as I had firmly made up my mind that, should there even be thunder and lightning, I must be an actor!

A short time after Mogulesko left, the actor [Jacob Gartenstein](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/G/gartenstein-jacob.htm) arrived in Philadelphia with a troupe, and when I heard that, I was very interested and knew that I should go talk to him about me and convince him to give me an opportunity to play some kind of role. He was a very unique person, Jacob Gartenstein, and it will not be excessive to mention here some details of his biography:

He is from Ukraine, and he came to America after the first pogroms of 1881 and 1882. He was one of the first Jewish actors that Goldfaden recruited when he created the Yiddish theater. And the other actors considered him to be an educated man; He spoke very good English and he also spoke Russian, German and French. That's what they said. He was associated with the Jewish theater for a few years and even though he was not one of the great actors, he was an ____^[Word does not translate: אויפטוער], indeed a bit of a swindler, too^[Indeed, Gartenstein was <a href = "">arrested in Philadelphia in 1888</a>.] And when he saw that he couldn't have any great luck on the stage, he suddenly opened a beer saloon in Philadelphia and it didn't go bad for him. But because of some story, which he picked up one day, he had to give up the beer saloon when he left Philadelphia for Chicago.
And what did he do in Chicago? There he turned completely away from the Yiddish theater and began to play the role of an intellectual, of the philosopher, and he became the president of some lodge, which bore the name of the famous philosopher Spinoza, and he gave lectures, and in the At the same time, he went into politics - American politics. And once he was even a candidate for Congress and during the elections he gave fiery 'campaign speeches.'
