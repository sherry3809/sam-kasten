> My _mame_ wanted me to make me a farmer. -- Her last words to me before she died.^[These are two _separate_ taglines. These were not her last words to him.]


3 System of payment in which each actor in the company received an agreed share of any profits (as opposed to wages), according to their ‘stamp’, expressed as a % figure.


In those days, people used to play for "stamps"^[System of payment in which each actor in the company received an agreed _percentage_ of any profits according to their "stamp."], and the actors could not behave peacefully around themselves, because every time they had to split the pitiful^[my translation; Sam uses "poor, miserable"] earnings among themselves, each one was sure that an injustice was being done to him, and he had grievances. Also in Gartenstein's troupe, who came to play Yiddish theater in Philadelphia, the actors used to fight. And these fights ended with the troupe splitting into two, and both left Philadelphia to try their luck in other cities.

That's usually how it went when one troupe became two. Playing at Gartenstein's got my head so twisted that I couldn't work in the shop anymore. I convinced myself that it no longer suits me to work in a shop. I opened a sort of dance class and in the evenings I taught young boys and girls to dance, and from this I got _"water-on porridge"_^[Phrase in Yiddish meaning to be dirt poor. So, he was not making a living with this.]. But I was still satisfied, because dancing has a bit of a relationship to theater...

At that time, the actor [Rudolph Marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_Marks)^[Read his Lekiskon entry <a href="https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/M/marks-rudolph.htm">here</a>.] came down to Philadelphia with a troupe. And as soon as I heard this, I immediately went to him.

-- Take me in,  - I requested of him. - I want to play theater and even more, I'd really fit the bill".


He was a very good actor, Rudolph Marks, and besides, he came from a very nice family, and they said that his father was a very great scholar who also wrote books in the _loshn-koydesh_^[the "holy tongue"; refers to Hebrew]. He himself, Rudolph Marks, was also an intelligent young man, and later he actually studied to be a lawyer and gave up the stage. But in the years when he was an actor, great hopes were placed on him and he was greatly praised, but the trouble with him was that, but what he really wanted was for people to consider him as great an actor as Mogulesko, and he made every effort to be a Mogulesko.

In Philadelphia, Rudolph Marks performed a play which he translated from English, and the play was called, I remember, "Sailor in Peril."^[From some cross-referencing, it is likely this was played _either_ in late March 1888, or late April 1889] I didn't ask Rudolph Marks for any money for my acting. It never occurred to me to ask him for money for my acting. I was satisfied with what he immediately gave me to play the role of a boy who sells newspapers in the streets, and I diligently began to study this role, and I was sure that I would play it very well. But when I arrived to the second or third rehearsal, Rudolph Marks took the role from me and told me to go home.

They didn't need me anymore... why?

Because Rudolph Marks realized that, just as Mogulesko had shown, he also wanted to show that he could play not just one role, but two and even three roles in one play, and indeed each all different sorts of character. And he decided that on top of the two roles that he was already playing, he should also play the role of the boy who sells newspapers in the streets...

Let Philadelphia see what he can do, and let them say he doesn't show the same skills as Mogulesko!...

And then something happened that is very characteristic of how things were. You could get away with things like this I could afford to do it in the meantime, and it is therefore worth telling here:
Together with a _landsman_^[someone from same region in the old country] of mine, who fell in with what I am going to tell here, I went to the theater where Rudolph Marks played the "Sailor in Peril." We sat there at every performance, and listening to every word, we transcribed the whole play, and afterwards we pieced it together in our own way, and indeed right away we put together our own troupe, rented the ["Dramatic Hall"](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/jqp-wheatley.htm)^[Located at the northeast corner of 5th and Gaskill, right above South Street.], and there we performed the same play, indeed our own "Sailor in Danger," that Rudolph Marks had played. And just like him, I played all three roles in the, and it was said to be good.

It had to be good, because I did the same as him in all three roles. I simply imitated him, and it was successful for me... He then became very angry with me, and threatened he would get even with me for this. But it didn't save him at all.


Whenever a Jewish troupe came to Philadelphia, I was the first to present myself to them to be given a role to play. And when [Boris Thomashefsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Thomashefsky)^[He would soon become a major figure in Yiddish theater in America; at this time, he was young and recently married to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessie_Thomashefsky">Bessie</a> (<a href="https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/T/thomashefsky-bessie.htm">Bessie's Lekiskon</a>.) Read Boris' Leksikon entry <a href="https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/T/thomashefsky-boris.htm">here</a>. It's also worth noting that Boris & his troupe were already in Philadelphia in competition with Gartenstein, and moreover we know from Bessie's memoir that in fact _they approached Sam_, and not vice versa, to invite him into their troupe. It was not too difficult to convince him, in part, because Sam and Bessie are cousins.] came down to play in Philadelphia and he staged the play "Honor thy Father"^[This is an old Goldfaden play, but there is little information on it.], he gave me the role of some _shames_^[Rabbi's assistant, essentially; this would be an extremely religious character.], and that, I think, was the first time I wore a beard on stage and played an older Jew^[According to Bessie's memories, Sam played in their troupe during the summer of 1889.]

Incidentally, I didn't give up that beard after playing there, and sometime later when I was working again in the shop where, as it used to go in those times, they sung Yiddish theater _lidlakh_^[songs] while working, all it took was for me to stroke my beard and call out some song, and the mood would be lively and cheerful.

Once, when I was at work in the shop, my sister Donia suddenly burst into the shop with some big news.

-- Sam! - she shouted with joy. - We've had a stroke of luck: I won ten thousand dollars!...

She won the ten thousand dollars in some lottery, and that brought a lot of joy to our family and we were suddenly prosperous.

Then my mother started to argue with me that I should knock "this _mishugas_" out of my head, meaning meant that I should no longer think about such a thing as becoming an actor.

-- It's not for you, Shmuel'ik - she said to me, calling me by my _haimishen_^["home"] name. - This is only for an idler, for a loafer, but not for you...

She was always looking for ways to get me to knock "this _mishugas_" out of my head. **START HERE:** The others in the family were also looking for ways to get me away from it. And because of that, they bought me a farm in Bridgeton, New Jersey, and I became a farmer. I then worked for a long time on the farm, which was bought for me, and I confess that the head was not with me at work, because the whole time I was always dreaming about playing on the stage. . But my mother did everything to make me forget about it, and once I even had to keep her word that I wouldn't become an actor...
She was very pleased with it, and as much as she could, she did everything in her power so that I should get used to the farm well and that I should not think about the theater, but you could still see that she Unrest goes on and it's clear that she is upset about what we and on the farm are doing and what I think so much about the theater.
This could be seen, although she was not touched by it. 
So a long time passed, and once when I was on the farm very busy with work, my sister came running to a farm.
– Sam, come quickly; Something happened to the mother!
