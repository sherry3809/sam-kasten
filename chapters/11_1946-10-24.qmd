> I play theater in the Brownsville of old times. - It starts well and ends poorly. - My wedding. - I sell my farm to [Israel Weinblatt](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/W/weinblatt-israel.htm).

This was still in those times when in Brownsville, _yiddishkeit_^[Yiddish culture; it's likely he is referring to _Jewish_ culture here] was felt at every turn. And even more than during the week, you could feel it on _shabes_^[Shabbat]. The shuls were packed. Jews went to pray, and just like in the shtetl in the old country, they took the children with them. And walking to the shul, they dressed up for _shabes_ and put on the tall black top hats on their heads, and in the street they all gave one another a _gut shabes_ and we everyone lived together as one big _mishpucha_ who suddenly felt the good taste of what it is like for Jews to live in a free country where you don't have to be afraid of anyone and where you can walk around the streets with your head held high. 

There in Brownsville, it wouldn't occur to even the greatest [_apikoros_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epikoros)^[heretic] to do such a thing as light a cigarette on _shabes_ in the middle of the street; He would be afraid to do such a thing, or people would shame him for doing it.

And everywhere, wherever we walked and wherever we stood, we saw how they were building and building; Everyone bought 'lots', everyone had plans, and whoever was able to undertake it, was drawn into the momentum of building the city, which later became one of the greatest Jewish cities in the world^[Recall, in 1946 when Sam was writing this, Brownsville was still 100% Jewish]. 

Everyone in Brownsville spoke amiably about the mud and filth^[This is not likely a correct translation, at all. Yiddish: די ציגען אוןדי בלאָטעם]. People did not complain about it. They were not ashamed of it. And in that alone there was also a characteristic _haimishe_ comfort.

Everything in Brownsville at that time had a genuine Yiddish style, and when you walked down the street and heard people speaking their own _haimishe_ kind of Yiddish, you could recognize who came from where and you already knew who was who - Who is a Litvak, who is a Galicianer, who comes from Poland, and who from Ukraine^[These regions all have different Yiddish dialects. Litvaks are Lithuanian/northeastern, and Galicianers are from the Galicia region, what is now part of Poland and western Ukraine]. 

And from the open windows of the houses, songs spread through the air - popular songs from the Yiddish theater, or Yiddish folk songs of all kinds. And here and there someone would even try out the _kehle_^[I can't find what song he is referring to: קעהלע] and he sang _chazanishe_ chants and would trill, just like that for his own enjoyment, so that he should feel at home/at ease in America...

Such a city was of course fit for a Yiddish theater. I was sure of this. Naturally, I immediately got to work, and the first play that we played there was Boris Thomashefsky's _"Aliles Dam^[Blood libel]
, or Menachem Ben-Israel"_.  That's what the play was called; One name for a play was not enough and therefore an "or" was usually added as well^[Most Yiddish plays at this time had two names, and Sam is being funny about it]... After that we played another play, and indeed again with an "or," as the style was: "The Female Pioneer, or Velvele eats compote" was the name of that play, and it was adapted by Thomashefsky^[Boris wrote this based on a play written previously by <a href="https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/B/bekerman-simeon.htm">Shimon Beckerman</a>/].

About such a thing as getting permission to play a play, there was very little concern. On top of that, I was already in touch with Thomashefsky because his wife Bessie and I were relatives,^[Almost certainly they are first cousins - their mothers are probably sisters] and Thomashefsky himself already knew me well and he got along very well with me^[Recall, they had also acted together in Philadelphia for the summer of probably 1888 or 1889].

The first couple of weeks in Brownsville didn't go badly, and I got exactly my salary - ten dollars a week. But after that it started to get worse and worse, until it became so bad that we received no salary and couldn't pay rent anymore. 

It was bad for me then, very bad. And in the moments when I was miserable and I was looking for a way to improve my dark fate, I used to spend time with the actors of the other troupe who were, at that time, playing in another casino in Brownsville. And during that time I became close friends with the actor [Charlie Cohan](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/C/cohan-charlie.htm)^[Sam and Charlie later became very close friends. Along with Sam's son Louis, Charlie was with Sam when he passed away. However, Sam is likely misremembering meeting Charlie in Brownsville: According to Charlie's obit in _Forverts_, he was born in 1886. So, he would not have been more than 6-8 years old at this time.], who is now the Secretary-Treasurer of the [Hebrew Actors' Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Actors%27_Union), and also with [Sigmund Weintraub](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/W/weintraub-sigmund.htm), who was not only a very good actor, but also a decent person, and moreover very smart and had a fine sense of humor.

We were all still young then, full of life; We could even make fun of our own troubles; I didn't allow myself any very big and heavy worries, and it was therefore a completely natural thing, that in such a time, when things were so bad and I wasn't receiving a salary, it should occur to me, that now is precisely the right time to get married...^[In fact, as we know from an article Sam wrote in 1913, his friend Jacob Frank suggested to him that if you're going to starve to death (Sam was eating maybe 1 piece of bread a day), you might as well get married first. <a href="https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/frw/1913/05/04/01/article/21/?e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7ctxTI--------------1">Source article</a>.]

Thought and done - I got married to the charming dark-haired girl Suzi, with whom I was so deeply in love.
And we held the wedding in our own way - with a benefit performance^[implying all proceeds go to support them] at Parmer's Casino. And all in all, the benefit brought in about thirty-five dollars. And after the religious ceremony, we had bread with herring and drank a little real liquor and it was lively and joyous.
