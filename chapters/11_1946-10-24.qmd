> I play theater in the Brownsville of old times. - It starts well and ends poorly. - My wedding. - I sell my farm to [Israel Weinblatt](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/W/weinblatt-israel.htm).

This was still in those times when in Brownsville, _yiddishkeit_^[Yiddish culture; it's likely he is referring to _Jewish_ culture here] was felt at every turn. And even more than during the week, you could feel it on _shabes_^[Shabbat]. The shuls were packed. Jews went to pray, and just like in the shtetl in the old country, they took the children with them. And walking to the shul, they dressed up for _shabes_ and put on the tall black top hats on their heads, and in the street they all gave one another a _gut shabes_ and we everyone lived together as one big _mishpucha_ who suddenly felt the good taste of what it is like for Jews to live in a free country where you don't have to be afraid of anyone and where you can walk around the streets with your head held high. 

There in Brownsville, it wouldn't occur to even the greatest [_apikoros_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epikoros)^[heretic] to do such a thing as light a cigarette on _shabes_ in the middle of the street; He would be afraid to do such a thing, or people would shame him for doing it.

And everywhere, wherever we walked and wherever we stood, we saw how they were building and building; Everyone bought 'lots', everyone had plans, and whoever was able to undertake it, was drawn into the momentum of building the city, which later became one of the greatest Jewish cities in the world^[Recall, in 1946 when Sam was writing this, Brownsville was still 100% Jewish]. 

Everyone in Brownsville spoke amiably about the mud and filth^[This is not likely a correct translation, at all. Yiddish: די ציגען אוןדי בלאָטעם]. People did not complain about it. They were not ashamed of it. And in that alone there was also a characteristic _haimishe_ comfort.

Everything in Brownsville at that time had a genuine Yiddish style, and when you walked down the street and heard people speaking their own _haimishe_ kind of Yiddish, you could recognize who came from where and you already knew who was who - Who is a Litvak, who is a Galicianer, who comes from Poland, and who from Ukraine^[These regions all have different Yiddish dialects. Litvaks are Lithuanian/northeastern, and Galicianers are from the Galicia region, what is now part of Poland and western Ukraine]. 

And from the open windows of the houses, songs spread through the air - popular songs from the Yiddish theater, or Yiddish folk songs of all kinds. And here and there someone would even try out the _kehle_^[I can't find what song he is referring to: קעהלע] and he sang _chazanishe_ chants and would trill, just like that for his own enjoyment, so that he should feel at home/at east in America...
