This was still in those times when in Brownsville, _yiddishkeit_^[Yiddish culture; it's likely he is referring to _Jewish_ culture here] was felt at every turn. And even more than during the week, you could feel it on _shabes_^[Shabbat]. The shuls were packed. Jews went to pray, and just like in the shtetl in the old country, they took the children with them. And walking to the shul, they dressed up for _shabes_ and put on the tall black top hats on their heads, and in the street they all gave one another a _gut shabes_ and we everyone lived together as one big _mishpucha_ who suddenly felt the good taste of what it is like for Jews to live in a free country where you don't have to be afraid of anyone and where you can walk around the streets with your head held high. 

It was there in Brownsville that even the greatest [_apikoros_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epikoros)^[heretic] would not think of such a thing as smoking a cigarette on Shabes in the middle of the street; He was afraid to do this, or he was ashamed of himself.
