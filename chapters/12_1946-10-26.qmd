> Thomashefsky and Karp[^Introduced in chapter 6] come to my aid in Brownsville. - **Mogulesko's** well-known song _Min Hameitzar_^[מן המצר; This song title is derived from <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/min-ha-meitzar-calling-to-god-from-the-depths/">Pslam 118</a>.]

The whole Pesach _yontif_ came and went, and not a single Jew came to our theater. And after the _yontif_ was over, we came up with a new idea for how to attract the Jewish community of Brownsville to come to our performances in Parmer's Casino.
