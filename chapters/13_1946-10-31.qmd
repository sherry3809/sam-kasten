> I pair up with Abba Schoengold to play theater in Boston and get a big surprise. - When the famous [Morris Gest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Gest) from Broadway was a messenger-boy in the Jewish theater.



What should not be said about the well-known Yiddish actors of those times^[Something is missing in translation here. Perhaps the previous sentence has a different connotation.] - one thing, however, must be added, and that is that they did not limit themselves to New York as the only city where you could play Yiddish theater. They thought that in America, there are endless cities with Jews and Yiddish theater should be played there not only after the end of the season, but during the season, in New York. Exactly how they did in New York.


It started because conditions were such that they, the well-known Jewish actors of those times, always had to be looking for a livelihood from somewhere. In addition, it was often difficult to empathize with each other because of professional jealousy, and therefore while traveling around the cities, throughout their journey, they were always looking for opportunities to have greater prestige than in New York. And in their travels, they made Yiddish theater popular among the Jewish public in America and, as they say today, to "spread the Jewish word."

With all the _chesed_^[mercy, grace, benevolence] that could be found in the how Yiddish theater was once performed across the country, something was accomplished with it, and if among the "long-standing;deeply-rooted"^[perhaps this implies assimilated: אלט–געזעסענע] Jews in America who are estranged from us, find themselves remembering from long ago a beautiful Yiddish tune, an old one, and because of this feel more connected to Judaism/Jewishness^[Not sure this is exactly correct, could be "Jewish community/collective"?; he writes: אידישען כלל], the traveling actors of old certainly had a part in that.

That's how I think of it. And there is no doubt in my mind that many who are familiar with the history of the Yiddish theater in America will agree that I am right.

Among the actors, who traveled a lot across America and played everywhere there was a considerable Jewish population, was also Abba Schehngold, one of the first pioneers who created the Jewish theater. He was by nature one of those who are always looking for something and even though he was lazy in his pursuit, there was something in him that should have reminded me of an artistic pursuit.
I remember how once, in the middle of winter, when I was in Brownsville having great troubles, Abba Schehngold came to me with a message:

-- Kestin, you don't have to worry at all; We are going to Boston!

-- And what will happen in Boston?

-- What does that mean? We will play theater there and we will earn money.


At that time, he was so involved in the plan, which he already had, that he just didn't listen to what I was talking to him, and he told me that they were going to play 'The Lost Soul', and in the play He said, you will play Shmuel’ikele and she, your wife, will play Babele, and remember my words - it will be good!
