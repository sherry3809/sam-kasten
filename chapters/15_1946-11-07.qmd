> The fire in the Yiddish theater in Baltimore in which 22 people were killed. - The comedian Tanzman who could not dance^[This is a pun - Tanzman means "dance man."].

In the operetta "Meilitz Yosher" that we were playing in Boston, the character I played was sent to prison and put in shackles, and from there I sang the song ["The Moral."](https://www.loc.gov/resource/ihas.200185539.0)^[I suspect there is a particular Yiddish connotation to the world "moral"]

> ^[Translation by me, with (?) indicating lines I'm very unsure of.] The moral remembers for a long time
>
> It leaves trace upon trace,
>
> Though in every place and case,
>
> It has a different face.
>
> Lying imprisoned, tied down
>
> in long, countless chains.
>
> (?) Suddenly from the prison cell's wall
>
> (?) will freedom ever come once more.
> 
> And when you sees the tracks
>
> from the chains all around,
>
> Oh, it will lie in your memory, 
>
> the iron moral.
>
> Yes, the moral, the moral, 
>
> Does good everywhere.


Singing alone was not enough for me, so on top of that I also - of my own accord - did a dance after as well, and I danced in the chains, and this was a big hit with the audience, and I therefore received a lot of applause at each performance. .

The audience was just simply pleased when I danced in chains...

Tanzman also played the same role; we were both offered the same role in "Meilitz Yosher." And since Tanzman could not dance at all, he he did not excel as much as I did in the role, and this made him very resentful and he urged me not to dance in the role either.

-- What is this dancing right in the middle of the scene? - he scolded me. - There's no need to dance. No one is expecting you to dance!...

But I was firm and obstinate:

-- It will do you no good, even if you stand on the roof^[This phrase is likely religious in origin - when the Messiah comes, he will "stand on the roof of the Temple." Sam saying:, even if you were the messiah telling me to stop dancing, it would be to no avail.]; I can dance, so I dance. If you could dance, you would certainly dance too...

We often fought over this and Abba Schoengold always had to work to make peace between us. And when the operetta _Meilitz Yosher_ was taken down from the stage and we started playing other pieces, the business in Boston did not go so well, and then [Madame Keni Lipzin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keni_Liptzin)^[Read her [Leksikon entry here](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex/L/lipzin-keni.htm)] was brought down from New York to rescue the situation. She appeared in "The Bowery Tramp"^[A play written by Rudolph Marks], in "The Lost Soul,"^[Recall Sam was in this play in [Chapter 14](14_1946-11-02.qmd)], and "Rachel and Leah"^[I can't find this play. It's rather hard to google...], and that did help a little, but really only a little, not much. Soon it became bad again and we couldn't pull through. It just wasn't working.
