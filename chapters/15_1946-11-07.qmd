> The fire in the Yiddish theater in Baltimore in which 22 people were killed. - The comedian Tanzman who could not dance^[This is a pun - Tanzman means "dance man."].

In the operetta "Meilitz Yosher" that we were playing in Boston, the character I played was sent to prison and put in shackles, and from there I sang the song ["The Moral."](https://www.loc.gov/resource/ihas.200185539.0)^[I suspect there is a particular Yiddish connotation to the world "moral"]

> ^[Translation by me, with (?) indicating lines I'm very unsure of.] The moral remembers for a long time
>
> It leaves trace upon trace,
>
> Though in every place and case,
>
> It has a different face.
>
> Lying imprisoned, tied down
>
> in long, countless chains.
>
> (?) Suddenly from the prison cell's wall
>
> (?) will freedom ever come once more.
> 
> And when you sees the tracks
>
> from the chains all around,
>
> Oh, it will lie in your memory, 
>
> the iron moral.
>
> Yes, the moral, the moral, 
>
> Does good everywhere.
