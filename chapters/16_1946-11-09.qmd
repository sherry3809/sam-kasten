> The frequent quarrels among Yiddish actors of old. - They used to fight over their source of income, over roles, and even more over love^[as in, love affairs]. - A quarrel between the actors {{< var schoen >}} and Tanzman, because of Mrs. Tanzman's role.

Together with {{< var frank >}} and with {{< var jakele-full >}}, I {{< var schlepped >}} around the provinces and it was, as they say, all ups and downs - here it was good and there it, and it turned out like in Pharaoh's dream: The seven lean cows ate the seven fat cows, and you were always twisting your head wondering what would come next.

Oftentimes it was like this - we would arrived in a city just when, only a few days earlier, another wandering troupe had just departed, and they had just "skimmed the top off" so there was nothing left for us. Sometimes, just as we arrived in a city, we would meet another wandering Yiddish troupe who was playing the same plays that we had chosen to play.

In general, there was terrible and fearful confusion; People tripped over each other's feet, bumped into each other's heads, and everyone got in one another's way.

In more than one city, {{< var jakele-full >}} displayed his resourcefulness to get to out of an unpleasant situation, and on a regular basis, an ingenious idea would strike him upon and it was really something astonishing, and the main thing was - as bad as it got, he didn't give up and he always encouraged us. Even when he himself was feeling down^[Sam actually writes, "when he had no {{< var yontif >}}_'dige_ in his heart," meaning no sense of joy or festivity], he nonetheless was still able to pass the time reading Shakespeare's _Halmet_ for the umpteenth time, always exclaiming with enthusiasm:

-- I say, {{< var chevreh >}}^[Here, this means "dear friends"], this is a _play_ - a rare thing in this world! 

He was always reading plays. Printed and also hand-written. And he had a such good memory, that it was enough for him to just see a play on the stage once or twice, and he had already memorized it...

On top of this, he also always dressed very nicely and elegantly, and I liked that very much about him, because I always liked to dress nicely and elegantly And {{< var jakele-full >}} always behaved like a real gentleman who really attracted the ladies...

While wandering from city to city, we never arrived anywhere prepared; No one expected us anywhere and no one was eagerly awaiting our arrival. We just wandered, in demand or not. Sometimes you found yourself in a good spot, or sometimes you didn't and it was bad, and in those times it was really miserable and gloomy. And once, when we arrived in Cleveland, we were straight away given some good news - the troupe of {{< var abba-full >}} and Mr. and Mrs. Tanzman was already playing here. The same troupe that I left after fighting with Tanzman.

I mention this, because from what I am going to tell you, you will be able to get a sense of the atmosphere that then reigned in our theater circles, and all in all is very characteristic of all the chaos of that era.


It was necessary for one of us to meet with Tanzman and talk with him about what could be done so that we could also make something out of being in Cleveland and so that we could at least continue to cover our expenses. And it was decided that {{< var frank >}} should to go to Tanzman. I could not go to Tanzman because we had fought.

So {{< var frank >}} went to him and he didn't come back... 

He stayed with Tanzman's troupe and and played with them there, and where were left neither here nor there^[with nowhere to turn, stuck], so {{< var jakele-full >}} also left and I was left alone and exposed and there was nothing I could do.

That's how Tanzman got even with me for the fight we had had before in Baltimore. He could not forget about it, and he could not let go of his anger towards until he got his revenge.


In general, Yiddish actors in the troupes at that time already had a fought a little too much, not only about income and about roles, but also about various other kinds of things; Morale was not at all high, and when an actor had a jealous wife, or an actress had a jealous husband, tempestuous and boisterous scenes often played out, and everyone had something to talk about and someone to gossip about; Everyone was talking about some kind of episode, and it was nothing new for someone to steal another's wife or husband. And when such a thing happened, the whole troupe was thrown into such a {{< var tumult >}} over it, and they all cast the blame at one another sins at each other, and it was such a mess...
