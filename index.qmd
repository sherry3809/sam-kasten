# Preface {.unnumbered}

Like many other well-known names in the American Yiddish theater, Sam Kasten (written in Yiddish as "Kestin"), my great-great grandfather, published his memoirs as serialized articles in _Forverts_ (_The Forward_, aka _The Jewish Daily Forward_).
He wrote two articles per week, from September 1946 - February 1947.

I obtained all articles from [The National Library of Israel](https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/frw), and, for those newspaper editions that were not available online, from the [New York Public Library's](https://www.nypl.org/) microfiche archives.

This e-book contains my translation of these memoirs, with some important caveats:

**This is an "alpha" version of the translation.**

I do not (yet!) really know Yiddish, so I performed all translating by typing into Google Translate, with some help from a separate dictionary.
Rather than directly typing what Google Translate has spit out, I've rephrased things so they flow well in English.
For the most part, I believe I have retained the original meanings, but it's worth noting that I may not have correctly gotten the original meaning!
I therefore _italicize_ aspects whose translations I don't think are reliable.

Where possible, I have cross-referenced items Sam discusses, as detailed in footnotes and inserted images.
All newspaper clippings are from archives in [The National Library of Israel](https://www.nli.org.il/en).

As I begin my journey to learn Yiddish, I plan to return and update this translation as part of a _very long-term project_.

Much thanks to Steve Lasky and other volunteers at the _Museum of the Yiddish Theatre_ for making many translations from [Zalmen Zylbercweig's _"Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater"_](https://www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/lex-biography.htm) available!
Thanks also to librarians at [NYPL's Dorot Division](https://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/jewish-division) for support finding the "missing" articles!

In memory of Sol Glassman ז׳׳ל, whose untimely death sent me down an ancestry rabbit hole wherein I accidentally ended up at Sam (who is wholly unrelated to Sol), and discovered a treasure trove of Yiddish writings.
Uniting the two sides of my family through Yiddish Theater is, simply put, _beshert_.
